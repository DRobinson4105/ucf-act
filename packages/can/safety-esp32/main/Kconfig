        bool "Bypass Planner heartbeat check"
        default n
        help
            Treat the Planner (Jetson) as always alive. Prevents
            NODE_FAULT_ESTOP_PLANNER_TIMEOUT when testing Safety
            without a Planner on the CAN bus.

    config BYPASS_CONTROL_HEARTBEAT
        bool "Bypass Control heartbeat check"
        default n
        help
            Treat the Control ESP32 as always alive. Prevents
            NODE_FAULT_ESTOP_CONTROL_TIMEOUT when testing Safety
            without a Control ESP32 on the CAN bus.

    config BYPASS_PUSH_BUTTON
        bool "Bypass push button e-stop (HB2-ES544)"
        default n
        help
            Force the push button e-stop to always read as inactive
            (not pressed). Use when the HB2-ES544 is not connected
            during bench testing.

    config BYPASS_RF_REMOTE
        bool "Bypass RF remote e-stop (EV1527)"
        default n
        help
            Force the RF remote e-stop to always read as inactive
            (not engaged). Use when the EV1527 RF remote receiver
            is not connected during bench testing.

    config BYPASS_ULTRASONIC
        bool "Bypass ultrasonic sensor (A02YYUW)"
        default n
        help
            Force the ultrasonic sensor to always read as clear
            (no obstacle) and healthy. Use when the A02YYUW sensor
            is not connected during bench testing. Without this
            bypass, a disconnected sensor triggers estop_ultrasonic
            due to the fail-safe health check.

menu "Debug Logging"

    config LOG_HEARTBEAT_TX
        bool "Log periodic heartbeat TX"
        default n
        help
            Log every periodic heartbeat transmission (100ms interval).
            Very verbose. Useful for confirming CAN TX is working.
            State-change heartbeats are always logged regardless.

    config LOG_HEARTBEAT_RX
        bool "Log every heartbeat RX"
        default n
        help
            Log every received Planner and Control heartbeat, not just
            state changes. Very verbose. Useful for confirming CAN RX
            is working and checking sequence numbers.

    config LOG_ESTOP_INPUTS
        bool "Log e-stop input readings each cycle"
        default n
        help
            Log all e-stop input readings (button, remote, ultrasonic,
            planner, control) every safety loop iteration (50ms).
            Extremely verbose. Useful for debugging sensor wiring.

    config LOG_STATE_MACHINE
        bool "Log state machine evaluation each cycle"
        default n
        help
            Log the system state machine inputs and result every
            safety loop iteration. Verbose. Useful for debugging
            state advancement issues.

            help
                Log when the push button e-stop changes state
                (pressed/released). Useful for verifying wiring
                and switch operation.

                Log when the RF remote e-stop changes state
                (engaged/disengaged). Useful for verifying
                receiver wiring and remote operation.

                Log when the power relay is enabled or disabled.
                Enabled by default since relay transitions are
                infrequent and safety-relevant.

                Log every valid distance reading from the A02YYUW sensor.
                Verbose (~5-10 logs/sec). Useful for verifying sensor
                operation and checking distance values.

                Log raw hex bytes received from the A02YYUW UART.
                Extremely verbose (~10 logs/sec). Useful for debugging
                wiring or protocol issues at the byte level.

                Log when received UART bytes fail to parse as valid
                A02YYUW frames (bad checksum, missing header). Useful
                for diagnosing noisy or intermittent connections.
